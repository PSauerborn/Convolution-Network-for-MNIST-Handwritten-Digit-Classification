# Convolution-Network-for-MNIST-Handwritten-Digit-Classification
Convolution neural network used to classify images of hand written digits from 0-9

The scripot generates a convolution model that is then used to classify hand written digits from the MNIST data set. 
Note that this requires the MNIST data set (not included with files) to be in the same directory as the script for the model
